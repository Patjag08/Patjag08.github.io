# Sweethedges Exampler Website
This was my first HTML + CSS project with a small bit of js integration and was proposed to me by a teacher, the project drew inspiration from the original site where i then drew up plans for the site (Wireframe etc). It then went to learning the basics of html where i prototyped the nav bar drawing from a simple HTML list component to then spicing it up with CSS to result in the final product. While the site does not have much depth it was a good starting point for learning the extreme basics having it serve as an informational site rather than being extremely interactive.

## Basic explanation of the site
The site functions as an informational site like mentioned earlier providing good descriptions of the real place as well as working on the original sites downfalls such as weak styling choices and inconsistant information. The original site was lacking in information for food as well as images for food. My main point of updating the site was to address the styling which has been addressed well in my opinion as well as including social links in the footer for better usability.

## AI Disclaimer
The only use of AI in the project lifecycle was the descriptions which in order to save time on the project were written by AI and if the site was to be deployed it would require going over and doing the descriptions by hand.
